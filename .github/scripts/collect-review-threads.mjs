/**
 * Write the PR's existing review threads to a file the review prompt includes,
 * so a re-run can see what it already said and what a human already answered.
 *
 * Without this the reviewer is blind to its own history. It said so itself, in
 * two consecutive reviews on #24:
 *
 *   > I could not enumerate the existing inline threads — `gh api
 *   > .../pulls/24/comments` is not permitted in this environment and `gh pr
 *   > view --comments` returns only top-level comments
 *
 * so it restated findings that already had threads rather than risk duplicates.
 * The consequence is worse than duplication: resolving a thread suppresses
 * nothing, so a finding a human considered and declined comes back every round,
 * and a bounded review loop cannot converge on anything it was told to drop.
 *
 * Resolution state is GraphQL-only — the REST `/pulls/{n}/comments` payload has
 * no `isResolved` — which is why this runs here with the job's own token rather
 * than being handed to the reviewer as a shell command. The reviewer gains no
 * new tool permissions; it just gets a file.
