/**
 * Fail the build when the automated review reports anything at or above MEDIUM.
 *
 * Reads the review's structured output — see `.github/review-schema.json` for
 * the shape and `.claude/review-prompt.md` for the rubric that assigns
 * severities. Findings are emitted as workflow annotations so a failure lands
 * on the diff in the Files tab rather than only in the log.
 *
 * Whether this actually blocks a merge is a branch-protection setting, not a
 * property of this script: it fails the job either way, and marking the check
 * required is the separate, reversible decision that turns that into a gate.
 *
 * There is deliberately no override label. Bypassing a failed check is
 * something branch protection already gates on permission and records against a
 * person; a label would be a weaker parallel mechanism that anyone with write
 * access could apply, and — being attached to the PR rather than to the finding
 * — would go on suppressing findings from every later push.
